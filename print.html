<p><code>landon</code> is a collection of heavily unit and integration tested tooling, data structures and methods for
exporting data (such as meshes and armatures) from blender preparing it for your rendering pipeline.</p>
<p>A typical <code>landon</code> workflow involves running the mesh/armature data export scripts
(optionally supplemented with your own Python scripts) from Blender via the CLI or Rust API.</p>
<p>All export scripts write json <code>stdout</code>.</p>
<p><code>landon</code> provides APIs to parse this data from stdout into Rust structs - but you can also read the JSON
output yourself if you don't use Rust.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// Parsing exported landon data via the Rust API.
// Rust is not required - you can read the exported JSON data with any programming language.
let meshes = blender_mesh::parse_meshes_from_blender_stdout(&amp;blender_stdout);
let armatures = blender_armature::parse_armatures_from_blender_stdout(&amp;blender_stdout);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><code>landon</code> can export data that most other exporters typically don't, such as <a href="https://docs.rs/blender-mesh/latest/blender_mesh/struct.BlenderMesh.html#method.custom_properties">custom mesh properties</a>
and bone groups.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#goals" id="goals">Goals</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Make it as easy as possible to take something from Blender and render it in your application without straying from the raw Blender data
<ul>
<li>We favor exporting the data from Blender as is and then providing APIs to transform it in the different ways that you might like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#example-use-cases" id="example-use-cases">Example Use Cases</a></h2>
<p>Some examples of things that <code>landon</code> might help you do include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Export all of the meshes in a <code>.blend</code> file into a collection of <code>BlenderMesh</code>'s and call methods to get the vertex data such as positions, uvs and normals from that <code>BlenderMesh</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Export all of the armatures in a <code>.blend</code> file and call methods to get the interpolated joint data at a certain keyframe to power your skeletal animation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#landon-cli" id="landon-cli">Landon CLI</a></h1>
<p>The <code>landon</code> CLI wraps <a href="https://docs.rs/landon">landon's Rust API</a> in order to provide common functionality
via a command line interface.</p>
<p>This chapter walks through different example use cases.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#installation" id="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<pre><code>cargo install -f landon

landon install --mesh-to-json --armature-to-json --ik-to-fk

landon --help
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#chapter-structure" id="chapter-structure">Chapter Structure</a></h2>
<p>The chapter walks through real examples of exporting data from Blender files.</p>
<p>Examples provide <code>curl</code> commands to download Blender files to the <code>/tmp</code> directory, but
these files are also available offline by cloning the Landon repository.</p>
<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:chinedufn/landon.git
cd landon
</code></pre>
<h1><a class="header" href="#exporting-data" id="exporting-data">Exporting data</a></h1>
<p>The <code>landon export</code> command accepts the paths to multiple Blender files and
exports meshes and armatures from those files to stdout, strucuted as JSON.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently, <code>landon export</code> spawns a single Blender process and then iterates through your
specified files one by one, opening them in that process.</p>
<p>In the future we might explore allowing for splitting work between multiple Blender processes.</p>
<p>We'd first want to think through the best way to split up the work and we'd want to benchmark
different sized workloads to see how single process vs. multi-process performed in different
cases.</p>
<p>For the majority of workloads the single process approach should be just fine, especially
if your asset pipeline has caching and only exports data from Blender files that have changed since the
last time you exported data.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-export-format" id="the-export-format">The export format</a></h2>
<p>The CLI exported mesh and armature data to JSON.</p>
<p>Everything that is exported is documented in the <a href="https://docs.rs/blender-mesh/latest/blender_mesh"><code>BlenderMesh</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/blender-armature/latest/blender_armature"><code>BlenderArmature</code></a> docs.</p>
<p>Here's a quick example that you can copy and paste to export some data from a couple of
Blender files in order to get a sense of the output.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#blender-mesh" id="blender-mesh">Blender Mesh</a></h1>
<p>The <code>blender-mesh</code> crate contains data structures and methods for working with meshes.</p>
<p>While the guide will be written with Blender users in mind, please note that
a mesh is just a collection of data and as such almost all of <code>blender-mesh</code> knows nothing about
<code>Blender</code> and can be used standalone.</p>
<p>This chapter will introduce and explain different mesh data and functions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.rs/blender-mesh/latest/blender_mesh">full API documentation</a> can be found on <code>docs.rs</code>.</p>
<p>The JSON that is exported by the CLI matches the structure of the API, so the API is still a good
reference for CLI-only users.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#custom-properties" id="custom-properties">Custom Properties</a></h1>
<p><code>landon</code> exports all <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.79/data_system/custom_properties.html">custom properties</a> found on a mesh.</p>
<p>These can be useful when your application code wants to treat certain meshes differently based on certain
properties that you label the mesh with in Blender.</p>
<p>For example - you might have a linter that ensures that none of your meshes go above 200 vertices in order
to preserve your low poly art style.</p>
<p>There might be some exceptions to this rule - so your code might check for the <code>override_max_vertex_count</code>
custom property to enforce a different limit in special cases.</p>
<p>In Blender custom properties these can be added in the Object section of the Context panel.</p>
<p><img src="blender-mesh/custom-properties/./custom-properties.png" alt="Custom mesh properties" /></p>
<p>Int, Float, String and Vector custom properties are exported. Type information can be found next to every value
since the Rust API uses this to generate a type safe data structure.</p>
<p>Dictionaries are not currently supported - but feel free to open an issue if you need this.</p>

<p><code>landon</code> can export data from <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/shader/principled.html">Blender's Principled BSDF shader node</a>.</p>
<p>In the Rust API they're available through <a href="https://docs.rs/blender-mesh/latest/blender_mesh/struct.BlenderMesh.html#method.materials">BlenderMesh#method.materials</a>.</p>
<p>Currently the base color, metallic, roughness and normal map inputs are exported.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, if landon does not export something that you need please <a href="https://github.com/chinedufn/landon/issues">open an issue</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We support both uniform/scalar values and texture values for all inputs, with the exception of normal
maps where no use cases for a scalar value come to mind.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Base Color</th><th>Metallic</th><th>Roughness</th><th>Normal Map</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Uniform</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>☓</td></tr>
<tr><td>Texture</td><td>✓</td><td>✓*</td><td>✓*</td><td>✓**</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><em>* - metallic and roughness texture inputs must come through a <code>Separate RGB</code> node.</em></p>
<p><em>** - normal map textures must be inputted through a <code>Normal Map</code> Blender shader node.</em></p>
<p>Texture and scalar inputs can be mixed and matched.</p>
<p>For example, it's totally fine for your base color to be a uniform value and your metallic to come from
a texture.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#texture-inputs" id="texture-inputs">Texture Inputs</a></h2>
<p>Here's an example of how to input a texture into each supported input field.</p>
<p>Note that this screenshot reads metallic and roughness from the same texture, but you can also read them
from separate textures by using two <code>Separate RGB</code> nodes instead of one.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#scalar-material-inputs" id="scalar-material-inputs">Scalar Material Inputs</a></h2>
<p>Here's an example of how to input uniform values into the supported input fields.
Simply set your desired values in Blender's <code>Principled BSDF</code> shader node and they'll be exported.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#bone-groups" id="bone-groups">Bone Groups</a></h1>
<p><code>landon</code> exports all <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/armatures/properties/bone_groups.html">bone groups</a> found on an armature.</p>
<p>One use case for this data is render different animations for different parts of an armature.</p>
<p>For example - if your game character is walking while punching - you might want to play a walking animation
on it's lower body bones and a punch animation on its upper body bones.</p>
<p>In Blender you'd create a bone group for the upper body and another bone group for the lower body and then
use this data in your renderer when determining which bones to render.</p>

<p>Each action's <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/markers.html">pose markers</a> are exported.</p>
<p>One example use case is to have your application trigger a sound whenever a frame that has a
pose marker called &quot;Foot Contact&quot; is crossed.</p>
<p>Note that there is a difference between pose markers and scene markers. Make sure to <code>Show Pose Markers</code>
before attempting to create a pose marker.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#troubleshooting" id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h1>
<p>This chapter contains information about how to troubleshoot failed attempts to convert IK/FK rigs into FK rigs.</p>
<p>Over time we want to replace this information with code that makes it unnecessary.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#unorganized" id="unorganized">Unorganized</a></h2>
<p>Here we dump troubleshooting information as we run into it that we can later clean up and organize into the right chapters.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#fk-animation-slightly-off-from-ik-animation" id="fk-animation-slightly-off-from-ik-animation">FK animation slightly off from IK animation</a></h3>
<p>The FK animation isn't guaranteed to follow the same path as the original IK animation in between keyframes.</p>
<p>The IK rigs constraints might lead it to follow a certain path while the FK rig will simply have a roughly straight
interpolation between the keyframes.</p>
<p>To solve for this - run the IK to FK converter and then run both animations side by side in Blender.</p>
<p>If the FK rig is slightly out of place during a frame - insert a key at that frame on the original IK rig and
convert again.</p>
<p>In short - when the FK rig differs in interpolation from the IK rig it means you need more keyframes.</p>
